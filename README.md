# Custom Auth Solana Adapter

By default the CustomAuth and OpenLogin SDKs generate an Ethereum wallet for every user. **This library adds the ability to create a Solana wallet at the same time.**

Use this library if you: 

1. Have a need to use an already implemented authentication mechanism (although you could potentially use this with OpenLogin as well).
2. Want to generate a Solana wallet for every user that signs up for your service and have access to both the public and secret keys.

Use the adapter outright, or learn from the source code, either way the hope is that this can alleviate some of the pain of generating Solana wallets that are tied to users accounts and whose private key can be retrieved through the use of the custom auth library. 

# Installation

## Xcode Projects

_Select File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency_ and enter https://github.com/TOKR-labs/custom-auth-solana-adapter/.

### Swift Package Manager Projects
You can add CustomAuthSolanaAdapter as a package dependency in your Package.swift file:

```
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            name: "CustomAuthSolanaAdapter",
            url: "https://github.com/TOKR-labs/custom-auth-solana-adapter",
            branch: "main"
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to the CustomAuthSolanaAdapter "product" delivered by the CustomAuthSolanaAdapter "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "CustomAuthSolanaAdapter", package: "custom-auth-solana-adapter")
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply import CustomAuthSolanaAdapter wherever youâ€™d like to use it.

# Usage

1. Generate custom verifier config through Web3Auth dev console.
2. Install this package via SPM.
3. Use the `getTorusKeyAndGenerateSolanaKeyPair` method rather than the `getTorusKey` method when using a custom verifier.

## Code Example:

```
import Solana
import CustomAuthSolanaAdapter

// you can use any JWT lib or if you know the userId without having to decode you can do that 
let JWT = try? JWTDecode.decode(jwt: accessToken)
let claim = JWT?.claim(name: "userId")

// pull the user id off of the JWT token
guard let userId = claim?.string else {
    promise(.failure(.jwtDecodeIssue))
    return
}

let tdsdk = CustomAuth(
    aggregateVerifierType: .singleLogin,
    aggregateVerifierName:  "<CUSTOM_AUTH_VERIFIER_NAME>",
    subVerifierDetails: [],
    network: .TESTNET,
    loglevel: .debug
)

tdsdk.getTorusKeyAndGenerateSolanaKeyPair(
    verifier:  "<CUSTOM_AUTH_VERIFIER_NAME>",
    verifierId: userId,
    idToken: accessToken
)
    .done { data in
    
        guard let account = data["account"] as? Account else {
            // generation of solana account failed
            return
        }
    
        print("solana public key = \(account.publicKey)")
        print("solana private key = \(account.secretKey)")
        
        self.solana.auth.save(account)
            .onFailure { error in
                // something went wrong saving account to account storage
            }.onSuccess { _ in
                // account was saved successfully
            }
    
    }
    .catch { error in
    
        self.log.error("erorr: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        promise(.failure(.getTorusKeyFailure))
    
    }
```
